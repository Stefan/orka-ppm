Scenarios lets you test 'what-if' portfolio decisions without affecting live data. Create alternate resource plans, reprioritize projects, or simulate budget cuts. Compare scenarios side-by-side with quantitative scoring (NPV, ROI, strategic alignment). Present multiple options to executives with clear trade-off analysis. Essential for strategic portfolio planning and rebalancing during market shifts or organizational changes.
