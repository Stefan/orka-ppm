Budget Tracking helps you monitor planned vs actual spending across your project portfolio. Set baseline budgets, track commitments and expenditures, and view variance reports. Get alerts for over-budget projects and drill down into cost categories like labor, materials, or vendors. Use it during quarterly reviews to justify funding requests or reallocate resources. Real-time dashboards show portfolio-level budget health, helping PMOs maintain financial discipline.
