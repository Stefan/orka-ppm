# Registers (einheitliche Register)

Registers provide a unified way to manage risk registers, issue registers, and other register types across projects and portfolios. Create, filter, and update register items with consistent types and task linking. Backend: `backend/routers/registers.py`; data models in `backend/models/registers.py`. Use registers to keep risks, issues, and actions in one place with optional integration to schedules (task_id) and change management.
