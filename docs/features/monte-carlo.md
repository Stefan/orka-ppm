Monte Carlo simulation runs thousands of schedule and cost scenarios using probabilistic modeling. Define uncertainty ranges for task durations, costs, and dependencies. Get probability distributions for completion dates and total costs, not just single-point estimates. Use it for high-stakes projects where executives need confidence intervals (80% likely to complete by X date). Essential for portfolio-level risk analysis and contingency planning.
