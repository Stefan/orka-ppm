EAC (Estimate at Completion) Calculation forecasts final project costs based on current performance. Choose from methods like Bottom-Up, Top-Down, or Earned Value formulas. Input actuals to date, remaining work estimates, and performance indices for accurate predictions. Compare EAC against original budgets to identify at-risk projects early. Use during monthly portfolio reviews to communicate realistic completion costs to executives and adjust resource allocations proactively.
