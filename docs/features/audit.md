The Audit page provides a complete trail of all changes made across your PPM workspace. Track who modified projects, schedules, budgets, or risks, with timestamps and before/after values. Use it for compliance requirements, debugging issues, or understanding decision-making history. Filter by user, date range, or entity type to quickly find relevant changes. Export audit logs for external reporting. This helps PPM teams maintain transparency and accountability in portfolio decisions.
