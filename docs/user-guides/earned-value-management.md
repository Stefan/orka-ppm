# Earned Value Management User Guide

## Overview

Earned Value Management (EVM) integrates scope, schedule, and cost to measure project performance.

## Key Metrics

- **PV (Planned Value)**: Budgeted cost of work scheduled
- **EV (Earned Value)**: Budgeted cost of work performed
- **AC (Actual Cost)**: Actual cost of work performed
- **BAC (Budget at Completion)**: Total planned budget

## Performance Indices

- **CPI (Cost Performance Index)**: EV / AC. &gt;1 = under budget, &lt;1 = over budget
- **SPI (Schedule Performance Index)**: EV / PV. &gt;1 = ahead of schedule, &lt;1 = behind
- **TCPI (To Complete Performance Index)**: (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC). Required efficiency to meet budget

## Variance Analysis

- **CV (Cost Variance)**: EV - AC
- **SV (Schedule Variance)**: EV - PV
- **VAC (Variance at Completion)**: BAC - EAC

Use the Earned Value Dashboard to monitor CPI, SPI, EAC, and variance trends over time.
