# ETC/EAC Calculations User Guide

## Overview

ETC (Estimate to Complete) and EAC (Estimate at Completion) are key project controls metrics for forecasting remaining and total project cost.

## ETC Methods

- **Bottom-up**: Sum of detailed estimates for remaining work packages. Most accurate when work breakdown is complete.
- **Performance-based**: Uses CPI (Cost Performance Index) to adjust remaining budget: ETC = (BAC - EV) / CPI
- **Parametric**: Uses productivity factors and historical data to project remaining cost.

## EAC Methods

- **Current Performance**: EAC = AC + (BAC - EV) / CPI. Assumes current performance will continue.
- **Budget Performance**: EAC = AC + (BAC - EV). Assumes remaining work will be completed at budgeted rates.
- **Management Forecast**: Uses management's estimate of remaining cost (ETC) plus actual cost to date.

## Confidence Levels

Each calculation includes a confidence level (0–100%) indicating reliability based on data quality and method appropriateness.
