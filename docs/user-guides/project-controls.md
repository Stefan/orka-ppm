# Project Controls User Guide

Project Controls provides ETC (Estimate to Complete), EAC (Estimate at Completion), earned value management, and performance analytics.

## ETC/EAC

- **Bottom-up**: Sum of remaining work package estimates
- **Performance-based**: Uses CPI to adjust remaining work
- **Current performance EAC**: EAC = AC + (BAC - EV) / CPI

## Access

Navigate to **Project Controls** in the sidebar. Select a project to view ETC/EAC, forecasts, earned value metrics, and performance analytics.
