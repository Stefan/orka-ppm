# Approval Workflows User Guide

Change orders use configurable multi-level approval workflows.

## Workflow Levels

Approval levels are determined by change order value. Higher values may require additional approvers (e.g., project manager, portfolio manager, executive).

## Pending Approvals

Approvers see pending items in their queue. Each approval requires comments (mandatory for rejections).

## Delegation

When an approver is unavailable, approval can be delegated to another user with appropriate authority.
