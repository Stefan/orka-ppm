# Codebase cleanup (WIP)

Use this branch and PR for focused cleanup. Suggested areas:

- [ ] Remove dead code and unused exports
- [ ] Consolidate duplicated logic (e.g. costbook/lib)
- [ ] Align naming and file layout
- [ ] Tidy tests and docs
- [ ] Fix obvious tech debt (add as you find)

Merge into `main` when ready.
